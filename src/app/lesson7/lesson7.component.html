      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition of Skills:</strong> Skills are abilities or proficiencies developed through education, 
        experience, and practice. Some skills may be natural talents, but many can be acquired and improved over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In educational management, effective leadership depends on the specific skills required at different 
        levels of responsibility (e.g., teachers, supervisors, principals). Managers must adapt their skills 
        to evolving roles.
