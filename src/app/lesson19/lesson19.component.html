  <h1>Lesson 19: Delegating II</h1>

  <section class="main" #textDiv>

    <section class="component">
      <h2>1. Assignment of Tasks and Duties</h2>
      <p>
        This is the first and most crucial step in delegation. Tasks are assigned based on their nature, complexity, and
        alignment with the competencies of subordinates.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Understanding Work Complexity:</strong> The manager must analyze the task, break it into smaller
          components if necessary, and understand its complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Matching Tasks to Skills:</strong> Identify employees who have the necessary skills, knowledge, and
          interest to perform the task.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity in Task Definition:</strong> Clearly outline the goals, timelines, and expectations of the
          assigned task to eliminate ambiguity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a school annual day program, tasks such as stage decoration, coordinating with
        performers, and managing finances are divided among teachers based on their expertise.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="component">
      <h2>2. Granting Authorities</h2>
      <p>
        Merely assigning tasks is not enough; employees must be empowered with the authority to make decisions necessary
        to complete their tasks.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freedom to Act:</strong> Authority provides individuals the autonomy to strategize, make decisions,
          and solve problems independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Encouraging Creativity:</strong> Granting authority enables team members to explore creative
          solutions without excessive managerial oversight.</li>
        <li><strong>Balancing Authority and Responsibility:</strong> Authority must align with the responsibilities
          assigned to ensure seamless task execution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A team organizing a science exhibition is granted authority to choose themes,
        finalize budgets, and allocate resources while being accountable for meeting deadlines.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="component">
      <h2>3. Creation of Accountability</h2>
      <p>
        Accountability ensures that employees take ownership of their tasks and outcomes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear Communication of Expectations:</strong> Define what success looks like and set measurable
          outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Acknowledging Efforts:</strong> Recognize contributions to encourage a sense of responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Establishing Checkpoints:</strong> Periodically review progress to maintain alignment with goals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Teachers responsible for organizing a cultural event are required to present weekly
        updates to the principal, showcasing progress and addressing challenges.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="component">
      <h2>4. Conveying the Right to Act</h2>
      <p>
        Delegating authority should involve explicit communication that empowers subordinates.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Building Trust:</strong> Managers should trust employees to make decisions within their assigned
          roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Encouraging Initiative:</strong> Let subordinates know they have the authority to implement ideas
          and resolve issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Supportive Environment:</strong> Create an atmosphere where subordinates feel confident in
          exercising their authority.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A teacher leading a field trip feels empowered to make real-time decisions, such as
        altering plans due to unforeseen weather conditions, without seeking constant approval.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="component">
      <h2>5. Maintaining the Balance Between Authority and Freedom</h2>
      <p>
        Delegation requires a careful balance between granting authority and providing freedom while ensuring adherence
        to organizational goals.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Avoiding Micromanagement:</strong> While oversight is necessary, excessive control can stifle
          creativity and morale.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensuring Guidance:</strong> Provide support and resources while allowing employees to work
          independently.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A librarian given the responsibility to modernize the library with digital tools is
        also given the freedom to choose vendors and set timelines while adhering to the budget.</p>
    </section>
