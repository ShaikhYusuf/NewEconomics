    <section>
      <h2>Concept of Education Management</h2>
      <p><strong>Understanding Education Management:</strong> Educational management refers to the systematic
        planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of all activities and resources within educational
        institutions to achieve educational objectives effectively. It involves optimizing human and material
        resources to enhance teaching, research, and community engagement while fostering institutional growth and
        societal development.</p>

      <p><strong>Dynamic Nature of Educational Institutions:</strong> Educational institutions operate in a constantly
        changing environment influenced by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> The integration of modern tools and methods in the
          teaching-learning process.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy Changes:</strong> New governmental rules, regulations, and policies impact operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Societal Needs:</strong> Adjustments required to meet evolving societal expectations and demands.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Due to these factors, educational institutions must continuously improve internal processes and adapt to
        changes to maintain relevance and effectiveness.</p>

      <p><strong>Origin and Development:</strong> Educational management originated in the United States in the early
        20th century as a specialized field. The United Kingdom adopted this concept in the 1960s, emphasizing
        structured management in educational settings.</p>

      <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Henry Fayol’s Definition of Management:</strong> “To manage is to forecast and plan, to organize, to
        command, to co-ordinate, and to control.”</p>
      <p>Management involves a systematic process comprising five core functions: planning, organizing, commanding,
        coordinating, and controlling.</p>

      <p><strong>Definition of Educational Management:</strong> Educational management applies Fayol’s principles to
        educational settings, focusing on human resources, material resources, regulations, policies, and societal
        integration.</p>
